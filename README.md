# IPSET_Block
Dynamically Ban Malicious IP's using IPSET for ASUS routers

This script allows a Blacklist IPSET to be managed without user intervention.

For ASUS Routers where IPSET v6.x is installed, the Blacklist entries will auto-expire after 7 days (default) or this timeout value may be specified during the initial IPSET creation.
